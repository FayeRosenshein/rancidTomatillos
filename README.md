# RandcidTomatillos

### Learning Goals:
- Gain competency with React fundamentals
- Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
- Practice refactoring
- Create a multi-page UX using Router

### Abstract:

This app will show a variety of movies where a user can select a movie and find out various information about that movie, including a rating and budget. There is a section of suggested movies selected from the top rated movies in the list. There is a search feature so a user can search through the given movies with ease to find out if the app has this movie's information.

### Wins + Challenges:
Some challenges included: 
- Handling inconsitent data, during the first iteration we could expect there to always be a weeks worth of data. In the second iteration the data we were given was much less consitent and lead to the need to refactor a lot of our code related to finding week-long data.
- Fetching data while utilizing promises. Having to understand JavaScript execution context and the call stack in order to have functions call after the data has already been fetched. 
- Chart.js, learning how to utilize a third-party extension

Some wins included:
- Chart.js, we successfully implemented the extension which allowed us to display user data in a meaningful way.
- Testing in Mocha and Chai, we feel that our tests and test data allowed us to accurately gauge how the code would perform when the website was active
- Post request! We were able to send information to our API and update the DOM to match that updated data accordingly.  
- Project board utilization, we successfully utilized the project board tool, the issues tab, and had very positive and meaningful task delegation and communication by using these tools.
